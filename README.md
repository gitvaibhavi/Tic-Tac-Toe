## Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Flutter Game

### Description:
This is a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using Flutter. The game features a dynamic user interface with animated transitions and visual effects. It allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid with clear indications for player turns, game results (win or draw), and a restart option.

### Features:
- **Player Turn Indicator**: Displays the current player's turn (X or O).
- **Game Status**: Shows the winner or indicates if the game ends in a draw.
- **Interactive Grid**: Players tap on the grid to make moves.
- **Responsive UI**: Smooth animations and appealing UI design.
- **Restart Game**: Ability to restart the game after a completed match.
- **Customizable Design**: Uses gradients, box shadows, and vibrant colors for an attractive interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Flutter SDK**: Make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can check this by running `flutter --version` in your command prompt.
- **Dart SDK**: The Dart SDK comes bundled with Flutter.
- **IDE**: It's recommended to use an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio for Flutter development.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create and set up your Flutter project:

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit `Enter` to open the command prompt.

2. **Navigate to Your Desired Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to create your Flutter project. For example:
     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\desired\directory
     ```

3. **Create a New Flutter Project**:
   - Run the following command to create a new Flutter project named `TicTacToeFlutter`:
     ```bash
     flutter create TicTacToeFlutter
     ```

4. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:
   - Change into the newly created project directory:
     ```bash
     cd TicTacToeFlutter
     ```

5. **Open the Project in Your IDE (Optional)**:
   - If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can open the project by running:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```
   - For Android Studio, you can open the project from the IDE.

## Running the Project

- Before you start coding, you can run the default Flutter app to ensure everything is set up correctly. Make sure you have an emulator running or a physical device connected, then run:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   
### Usage:
- Launch the app on your emulator or physical device.
- The game starts by prompting Player X to make their move.
- Players alternate turns by tapping on the empty cells of the 3x3 grid.
- The game will end when either player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- Tap the "Restart Game" button to play again.
